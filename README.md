# AI-Celebrityselfies
Turn one photo into infinite possibilities. A simple Python tool to create AI selfies with celebrities, movie sets, and custom backgrounds using Generative AI.

Step 1: Create a Celebrity List
Start by making a list of all the celebrities you want to “take selfies with” in the video.

Step 2: Generate High-Quality Celebrity Images
Go to *NanoBanana (inside BeHooked.co)* — this works best because it’s far less censored.
Upload *your image as reference*, slightly adjust the prompt if needed, and generate.
 
 Base Prompt Template
(Use this first. If it doesn’t give great results, jump to *Step 6*.)

Create a realistic, high-fidelity (8K) image based on the attached reference photo.
Maintain the exact facial features, skin tone, bone structure, hairstyle, and expression of the attached person, with no alteration or face swapping.
The attached person is taking a selfie with [Celebrity], standing at [Set / Location].
Crew members are adjusting lighting and equipment, with cables and gear visible.
Directors and managers are standing behind, discussing the next take.

Step 3: Generate Images for All Celebrities
Repeat Step 2 for every celebrity on your list.
Once all images are ready, move to video generation.

 Step 4: Create the Video in *BeHooked.co*
1. Open *BeHooked.co*
2. Select *Veo 3.1* as the *Image-to-Video* model
3. Enable *First Frame / Last Frame*
How to Structure Each Clip
 *First Frame:* current celebrity image
 *Last Frame:* next celebrity image
 
 Video Prompt Template

In the first frame, the person takes a picture with [Celebrity 1].
He then runs toward another set, as seen in the final frame.
He meets [Celebrity 2] and takes a picture with them.
A handheld camera follows him throughout the entire sequence.
 
 Step 5: Final Editing
Once all clips are generated.
- Import them into your editing software
- Speed-ramp if needed (or keep natural motion)
- Add relevant Music
- Export as:
    - One continuous video **or**
    - Individual short clips for Reels / TikTok
That’s it.
That’s the viral celebrity selfie video effect.
